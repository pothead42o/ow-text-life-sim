It's very common to get stomach aches, headaches, and nasal congestion when you're sleep-deprived and your diet isn't the most balanced.  Don't worry, I have just the remedy for you!   To help with the stomach ache, I recommend a soothing herbal tea made with ginger and peppermint.  For the headache and nasal congestion, try a warm compress over your forehead and a steam inhalation with eucalyptus oil.  And most importantly, try to get some good sleep tonight!  You'll feel much better in no time. \n",
